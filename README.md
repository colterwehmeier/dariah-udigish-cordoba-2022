# Córdoba Patio Houses Heritage Walk

This repository contains the static site used to visualize the data collected from the "Patio Walk" during the European Heritage Days on October 7, 2022. This event was part of a broader effort to understand and document the material and immaterial heritage of Axerquía, a historic district in Córdoba.

See the visualization hosted here: [Patio Walk 2022](https://dariahcloud.web.illinois.edu/cordoba).

## About the Project

The "Patio Walk" project employed ICT tools to investigate the heritage value of collective housing in Córdoba, specifically focusing on the traditional patio houses. Volunteers equipped with GPS-enabled devices documented communal patios and conducted interviews with residents, contributing to a rich dataset of stories, images, and sounds.

## How to Use This Site

The static site serves as a digital tool to explore the collected data through an interactive map. Each marker on the map corresponds to specific data collected from different locations within Axerquía.

### Local Setup

```
Navigate to the project directory and serve the site locally using a local development server like the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code, or by using a simple HTTP server:

- If using Visual Studio Code:
  Install the Live Server extension, open the project folder, right-click on index.html, and select 'Open with Live Live Server'.

- Using Python's HTTP server:
  Run `python -m http.server` in your terminal in the project directory.
```
### Hosting on a Web Server

```
To host this site on a web server, upload the entire folder to your server's public directory and ensure the server is configured to serve static files.
